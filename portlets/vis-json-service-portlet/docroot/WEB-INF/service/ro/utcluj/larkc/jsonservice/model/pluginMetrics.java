/**
 * The model interface for the pluginMetrics service. Represents a row in the &quot;metricService_pluginMetrics&quot; database table, with each column mapped to a property of this class.
 *
 * <p>
 * Never modify this interface directly. Add methods to {@link ro.utcluj.larkc.jsonservice.model.impl.pluginMetricsImpl} and rerun ServiceBuilder to automatically copy the method declarations to this interface.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Never reference this interface directly. All methods that expect a plugin metrics model instance should use the {@link pluginMetrics} interface instead.
